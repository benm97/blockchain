Exercise 1

A partial prototype of blockchain implementation, relying on a trusted Bank and used by Wallets.
-The bank maintains a list of past accepted blocks, a list of transaction waiting to be accepted (mempool)
and a list of unspent txs (utxo). At "end day", the bank accept a new block and compute the updated utxo
-Each wallet have a private and public key. The wallet maintain a list of unspent transaction involving it as input
i.e. a list of coin to spend.
Coin are marked as "frozen" after use and need to wait to be accepted or unfreeze to be used again.
